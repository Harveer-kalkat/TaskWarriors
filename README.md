# TaskWarriors

A web application developed to match skilled University/college students with local demand. It is very 
similar to taskrabbit.com but only for students. The main purpose of this app is to provide students with 
industry experience as not all students are able to land internships. Here students can provide different 
services according to their courses or skills.
